# India GDP & GVA Analysis (Power BI)

This repository contains a Power BI analysis of India’s quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Value Added (GVA) using official data published by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), Government of India.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze India’s macroeconomic performance by examining:
- Long-term trends in GDP and GVA
- Quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth momentum
- Sector-wise GVA contribution
- Expenditure-side composition of GDP
- Relationship between GDP and GVA

The dashboard is designed to clearly separate aggregate economic indicators from structural decomposition to avoid misleading interpretations.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, where it is published as a consolidated version of official MOSPI releases.
